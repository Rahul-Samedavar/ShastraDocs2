For complex questions with multiple parts, identify:
1. Different processes or procedures mentioned
2. Specific information requests (emails, contact details, forms, etc.)
3. Different entities or subjects involved
4. Sequential steps that might be documented separately
5. Don't Include any extra messages or comments.

Original question: {original_query}

Break this into exactly {QUERY_EXPANSION_COUNT} focused search queries that target different aspects:

Examples of good breakdown:
- "What is the dental claim submission process?"
- "How to update surname/name in policy records?"
- "What are the company contact details and grievance email?"


Provide only {QUERY_EXPANSION_COUNT} focused sub-questions, one per line, without numbering or additional formatting:
Example Reponse:
Here are the focused sub queries
subquery1
subquery2 (if exists)

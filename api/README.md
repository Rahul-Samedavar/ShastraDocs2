# ShastraDocs API Package

A production-ready FastAPI REST API for the ShastraDocs document analysis system. This package provides secure, authenticated endpoints for document processing, question answering, and system management, along with a full set of endpoints to power its web-based user interface.

## üöÄ Overview

The API package serves as the main interface for the ShastraDocs system, offering:
- **User & Session Management**: Endpoints for user signup, login, and management of persistent document sessions.
- **Multi-Document Processing**: Upload and analyze multiple documents (8+ formats) within a session.
- **Interactive Question Answering**: A chat-style endpoint for querying across all documents in a session, with structured, referenced answers.
- **System Management**: Admin endpoints for monitoring and maintenance.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed request tracking and performance analytics.

import httpx
import asyncio

async def process_documents():
    url = "http://localhost:7860/hackrx/run"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer your_token"}
    
    data = {
        "documents": [
            "https://example.com/policy.pdf",
            "https://example.com/faq.docx"
        ],
        "questions": [
            "Summarize the policy coverage.",
            "How do I file a claim according to the FAQ?"
        ]
    }
    
    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=600) as client:
        response = await client.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
        result = response.json()
        
        for i, answer in enumerate(result["answers"]):
            print(f"Q{i+1}: {data['questions'][i]}")
            print(f"A{i+1}: {answer}\n")

asyncio.run(process_documents())
```

### cURL Examples

```bash
# Process multiple documents
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7860/hackrx/run" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "documents": ["https://example.com/doc1.pdf", "https://example.com/doc2.pdf"],
    "questions": ["Compare the conclusions of both documents."]
  }'

# Ask a question within a UI session
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7860/query" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "your_session_id_from_ui",
    "question": "What is this document about?"
  }'

# Upload a file to a session
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7860/upload" \
  -F "session_id=your_session_id_from_ui" \
  -F "files=@/path/to/your/document.pdf"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running the API

```bash
# Development mode with auto-reload from the project root
python app.py

# Production mode with uvicorn
uvicorn api.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860 --workers 4
```

### Testing

```python
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from api.api import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_health_check():
    response = client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"

def test_process_document_unauthorized():
    data = {
        "documents": ["https://example.com/test.pdf"],
        "questions": ["What is this about?"]
    }
    response = client.post("/hackrx/run", json=data)
    assert response.status_code == 403 # Depends on if Depends is caught by test client
```

### Custom Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for both user and system issues.
```json
// Example error responses
{ "detail": "Invalid authentication token" }
{ "detail": "Failed to process document: Unsupported file format" }
{ "error": "No documents in this session" }
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **User Passwords**: Stored directly in the database. For production, hashing should be implemented.
- **Bearer Token**: Core endpoints require a valid bearer token.
- **Admin Token**: Administrative functions use a separate token.

### Data Security
- **Document Caching**: Uploaded documents are stored on the server's filesystem. Ensure appropriate permissions.
- **Database**: Session and user data are stored in a SQLite database.
- **Secure Headers**: CORS and security headers are configured.
